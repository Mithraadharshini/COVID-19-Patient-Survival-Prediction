* COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has gained prominence as it has become the most widespread acute respiratory infection with global distribution and is characterized as a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days, with a median of 5 to 6 days and is responsible for variable symptomatology ranging from mild signs to severe conditions requiring hospitalization. The most common symptoms in hospitalized patients are fever, dyspnea, and ground-glass opacity demonstrated by imaging tests.

* The risk for a more severe form of the disease was associated with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking. Similarly, sociodemographic aspects such as advanced age (80 years or older), male sex, race/non-white color and being a public hospital user have been shown to contribute to a higher risk of death. In addition, it should be noted that a more critical course of the disease may promote increased hospital admissions and hospital length of stay , generating demands for health systems.

* In this sense, by identifying characteristics that favor a more severe outcome, and predicting the survival of patients.
